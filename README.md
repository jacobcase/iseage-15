Repository of materials for the 2015 cyber defense competition at Iowa State.

### Important
The source in web_ref is courtesy of Iowa State University Cyber Defense Club.  It is here to make it available
for easier reference.  The modified code for both web apps is in /banking and /brokerage.  It's not the cleanest
code due to time constraints, and the ansible could be improved, but this is only a starting point for next year.

### Password
Since the competition is over, we can reveal our passwords. The password to the ansible vault file under
ansible/group_vars/all/passwords.yml is X42tKkbD.  The flag is automatically added to the first web server
database, but we didn't have time to automate adding it to the second, so that has to be done manually.
